CSC 376 - Distributed Systems:

This set of java programs contain methods for network communication between programs using sockets and bit/string transfers.  Bluecat is the base program that establishes a link between programs, using the other functions as helpers.  MultiBinaryClient is a version of Bluecat that transfers bits instead of strings and thus can transfer files.  Most of all of the files was authored by me (Luke Fisher).

The culmination of this course can be seen in the HxNguye/puzzle Github that I am connected to.  This project is a simple text adenture puzzle that I worked on with some classmates.
