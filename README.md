# Academic_Code_Samples
Code samples from my time in college.

I did not include all of the projects and directories that I have because some were either too cluttered with unnecessary files provided by the professor or the code files were mostly written by the professor.

CSC_360_finalProject: 
HTML, CSS, and AngularJS website

CSC_376_Distributed_Systems: 
Java programs that illustrate network communications with sockets

CSC_380_babyNames_Markov_chain: 
Java AI program that makes use of markov chain generation

SE_350_FinalProject:

tsh.c:
